      <title>Blog: The future of gRPC in C# belongs to grpc-dotnet</title>
      <link>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future/</link>

      <description>
        TL;DR grpc-dotnet (the Grpc.Net.Client and Grpc.AspNetCore.Server nuget packages) is now the recommended gRPC implementation for .NET/C#. The original gRPC C# implementation (the Grpc.Core nuget package) will enter maintenance mode and won&amp;rsquo;t be getting any new features and will only receive important bug fixes and security fixes going forward. The ultimate plan is to phase out Grpc.Core completely at some point in the future. This announcement describes the reasons why we have decided to do so and lays out the plan in more detail.

      <description>
        Wireshark is an open source network protocol analyzer that can be used for protocol development, network troubleshooting, and education. Wireshark lets you analyze gRPC messages that are transferred over the network, and learn about the binary format of these messages.
In this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to configure and use the Wireshark gRPC dissector and the Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) dissector, which are protocol-specific components that allow you to analyze gRPC messages with Wireshark.

      <description>
        We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce support for interceptors in gRPC-web as of release 1.1.0. While the current design is based on gRPC client interceptors available from other gRPC languages, it also includes gRPC-web specific features that should make interceptors easy to adopt and use alongside modern web frameworks.
Introduction Similar to other gRPC languages, gRPC-web supports unary and server-streaming interceptors. For each kind of interceptor, we&amp;rsquo;ve defined an interface containing a single intercept() method:

      <description>
        As developers work to modernize applications, they need foundational tools that are simple and scalable. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source, universal RPC framework originally developed at Google that developers are adopting in tremendous numbers, helping them connect services more easily and reliably. Paired with Kotlin, the second most popular JVM-based programming language in the world, developers can build everything from mobile apps to cloud microservices. To help, we&amp;rsquo;ve open-sourced gRPC Kotlin for the JVM, allowing you to use gRPC with your Kotlin projects.

        For the past few months, Kitware Inc. has been working with the gRPC team to improve gRPC’s CMake support. The goal of the effort was to modernize gRPC’s CMake build with the most current features and techniques CMake has to offer. This has improved the user experience for gRPC developers choosing to use gRPC’s CMake as a build system. During the effort the CMake build was looked at as a whole, and CMake related issues in GitHub were explored and resolved.

        Dear gRPC,
We messed up. We are so sorry that we missed your birthday this year. Last year we celebrated with cake and fanfare, but this year we dropped the ball. Please don&amp;rsquo;t think that we love you any less.
You&amp;rsquo;re 4 now and that&amp;rsquo;s a big milestone! You&amp;rsquo;re part of so much amazing technology at companies like Salesforce, Netflix, Spotify, Fanatics, and of course, Google. In fact just this week the biggest API Google has went production-ready with gRPC.

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Channelz is a tool that provides comprehensive runtime info about connections at
different levels in gRPC. It is designed to help debug live programs, which may
be suffering from network, performance, configuration issues, etc. The
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A14-channelz.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gRFC&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides a
detailed explanation of channelz design and is the canonical reference for all
channelz implementations across languages. The purpose of this blog is to
familiarize readers with channelz service and how to use it for debugging
issues. The context of this post is set in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gRPC-Go&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the overall idea should be
applicable across languages. At the time of writing, channelz is available for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gRPC-Go&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and

In this article, we’ll look at how gRPC builds on HTTP/2’s long-lived connections to create a performant, robust platform for inter-service communication. We will explore the relationship between gRPC and HTTP/2, how gRPC manages HTTP/2 connections, and how gRPC uses HTTP/2 to keep connections alive, healthy, and utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve bought into this whole RPC thing and want to try it out, but aren&amp;rsquo;t quite sure about Protocol Buffers.  Your existing code encodes your own objects, or perhaps you have code that needs a particular encoding.  What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, gRPC is encoding agnostic!  You can still get a lot of the benefits of gRPC without using Protobuf.  In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll go through how to make gRPC work with other encodings and types.  Let&amp;rsquo;s try using JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;It is best practice to always clean up gRPC resources such as client channels, servers, and previously attached Contexts whenever they are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is even true for JUnit tests, because otherwise leaked resources may not only linger in your machine forever, but also interfere with subsequent tests. A not-so-bad case is that subsequent tests can&amp;rsquo;t pass because of a leaked resource from the previous test. The worst case is that some subsequent tests pass that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have passed at all if the previously passed test had not leaked a resource.&lt;/p&gt;

        Did you know that gRPC Java now has out of box support for Kotlin projects built with Gradle? Kotlin is a modern, statically typed language developed by JetBrains that targets the JVM and Android. It is generally easy for Kotlin programs to interoperate with existing Java libraries. To improve this experience further, we have added support to the protobuf-gradle-plugin so that the generated Java libraries are automatically picked up by Kotlin.

        &lt;p&gt;A common question with gRPC is how to make it fast.  The gRPC library offers users access to high
performance RPCs, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t always clear how to achieve this.  Because this question is common
enough I thought I would try to show my thought process when tuning programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the start of the new year, and almost the end of my first full year on the
gRPC-Go project, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to provide an update on
the state of gRPC-Go development and give some visibility into how we manage the
project.  For me, personally, this is the first open source project to which
I&amp;rsquo;ve meaningfully contributed, so this year has been a learning experience for
me.  Over this year, the team has made constant improvements to our work habits
and communication.  I still see room for improvement, but I believe we are in a
considerably better place than we were a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;For past few months we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving gRPC-Go performance. This includes improving network utilization, optimizing CPU usage and memory allocations. Most of our recent effort has been focused around revamping gRPC-Go flow control. After several optimizations and new features we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to improve quite significantly, especially on high-latency networks. We expect users that are working with high-latency networks and large messages to see an order of magnitude performance gain.
Benchmark results at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog summarizes the work we have done so far (in chronological order) to improve performance and lays out our near-future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Announcing out-of-the-box support for gRPC in the Flatbuffers serialization library</title>
      <link>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/grpc-flatbuffers/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The recent release of Flatbuffers &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;version 1.7&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduced truly zero-copy support for gRPC out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Flatbuffers&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a serialization library that allows you to access serialized data without first unpacking it or allocating any
additional data structures. It was originally designed for games and other resource constrained applications, but is now finding more general use, both by teams within Google and in other companies such as Netflix and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: gRPC Load Balancing</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;This post describes various load balancing scenarios seen when deploying gRPC. If you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://Joevaen.github.io/&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; with multiple backends, this document is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large scale gRPC deployment typically has a number of identical back-end instances, and a number of clients. Each server has a certain capacity. Load balancing is used for distributing the load from clients optimally across available servers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. Helm provides its users with a customizable mechanism for
managing distributed applications and controlling their deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the good fortune to be a member of the phenomenal open-source Kubernetes Helm community serving as
a core contributor. My first day working with the Helm team was spent prototyping the architecture for
the next generation of Helm. By the end of that day, we had procured the preliminary RPC protocol data model
used to enable communication between Helm and its in-cluster server component, Tiller.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In our previous blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/yik-yak-eng/migration-to-google-cloud-platform-overview-9b5e5c17c368&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;post&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we gave an overview of our migration to Google Cloud Platform from Amazon Web Services. In this post we will drill down into the role that &lt;a href=&#34;https://Joevaen.github.io/&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;grpc-gateway&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; played in that migration and share some lessons which we picked up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://Joevaen.github.io/&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier to build high-performance
microservices by providing generated service entrypoints in a variety
of different languages.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://bazel.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bazel&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; complements these
efforts with a capable and fast polyglot build environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rules_protobuf&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; extends
bazel and makes it easier develop gRPC services.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Why we have decided to move our APIs to gRPC</title>
      <link>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/vendasta/</link>

      <guid>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/vendasta/</guid>
      <description>
        Vendasta started out 8 years ago as a point solution provider of products for small business. From the beginning we partnered with media companies and agencies who have armies of salespeople and existing relationships with those businesses to sell our software. It is estimated that over 30 million small businesses exist in the United States alone, so scalability of our SaaS solution was considered one of our top concerns from the beginning and it was the reason we started with Google App Engine and Datastore.

      <title>Blog: gRPC Project is now 1.0 and ready for production deployments</title>
      <link>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/ga-announcement/</link>

      <guid>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/ga-announcement/</guid>
      <description>
        Today, the gRPC project has reached a significant milestone with its 1.0 release. Languages moving to 1.0 include C++, Java, Go, Node, Ruby, Python and C# across Linux, Windows, and Mac. Objective-C and Android Java support on iOS and Android is also moving to 1.0. The 1.0 release means that the core protocol and API surface are now stable with measured performance, stress tested and developers can rely on these APIs and deploy in production, they will follow semantic versioning from here.

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;As gRPC has become a better and faster RPC framework, we&amp;rsquo;ve consistently gotten the question, &amp;ldquo;How &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster is gRPC?&amp;rdquo; We already have comprehensive server-side benchmarks, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have mobile benchmarks. Benchmarking a client is a bit different than benchmarking a server. We care more about things such as latency and request size and less about things like queries per second (QPS) and number of concurrent threads. Thus we built an Android app in order to quantify these factors and provide solid numbers behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: gRPC with REST and Open APIs</title>
      <link>https://Joevaen.github.io/blog/coreos/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Our guest post today comes from Brandon Phillips of &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CoreOS&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. CoreOS builds open source projects and products for Linux Containers. Their flagship product for consensus and discovery &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/etcd/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their container engine &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/rkt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rkt&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are early adopters of gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons CoreOS chose gRPC is because it uses HTTP/2, enabling applications to present both a HTTP 1.1 REST/JSON API and an efficient gRPC interface on a single TCP port (available for Go). This provides developers with compatibility with the REST web ecosystem, while advancing a new, high-efficiency RPC protocol. With the recent release of Go 1.6, Go ships with a stable &lt;code&gt;net/http2&lt;/code&gt; package by default.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google Cloud PubSub&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Google&amp;rsquo;s scalable real-time messaging service that lets users send and receive messages between independent applications. It&amp;rsquo;s an important part of Google Cloud Platform&amp;rsquo;s big data offering, and is used by customers worldwide to build their own robust, global services. However, until now, the only way to use the Cloud PubSub API was via JSON over HTTP. That&amp;rsquo;s all changed with the release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/03/announcing-grpc-alpha-for-google-cloud-pubsub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PubSub gRPC alpha&lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;strong&gt;users can access PubSub via gRPC&lt;/strong&gt; and benefit from all the advantages it brings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        The gRPC team is excited to announce the immediate availability of gRPC Beta. This release marks an important point in API stability and going forward most API changes are expected to be additive in nature. This milestone opens the door for gRPC use in production environments.
We’re also taking a big step forward in improving the installation process. Over the past few weeks we’ve rolled out gRPC packages to Debian Stable/Backports.

      <description>
        Motivation Google has been using a single general-purpose RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect the large number of microservices running within and across our data centers for over a decade. Our internal systems have long embraced the microservice architecture gaining popularity today. Having a uniform, cross-platform RPC infrastructure has allowed for the rollout of fleet-wide improvements in efficiency, security, reliability and behavioral analysis critical to supporting the incredible growth seen in that period.
